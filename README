These are some code examples for interacting with the OpenStack APIs using Ruby. Most of these are results experimenting with the NeCTAR research cloud (nectar.org.au). 

These examples are based on http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-compute/programmer/content/index.html.

You will need to create a 'credentials.rb' file in the following format:

$PASSWORD = 'YOUR_PASSWORD' # From the Dashboard/credentials page (in the NeCTAR case it is NOT the password you use to login).
$USER = 'YOUR_USERNAME' # Just your regular username.
$TENANT_ID = 'YOUR_TENANT_ID' # This is a number that, I think, comes from the Nova database. You may need to contact your administrator for this number.


You will also need the json gem:
bundle install json
