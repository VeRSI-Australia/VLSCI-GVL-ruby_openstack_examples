These are some code examples for interacting with the OpenStack APIs using Ruby. Most of these are results experimenting with the NeCTAR research cloud (nectar.org.au). Based on http://docs.rackspace.com/servers/api/v1.0/cs-devguide-20120320.pdf

You will need to create a 'credentials.rb' file in the following format:

$PASSWORD = 'YOUR_PASSWORD' # From the Dashboard/credentials page (in the NeCTAR case it is NOT the password you use to login).
$USER = 'YOUR_USERNAME' # Just your regular username.
$TENANT_ID = 'YOUR_TENANT_ID' # This is a number that, I think, comes from the Nova database. You may need to contact your administrator for this number.


You will also need the json gem:
bundle install json
